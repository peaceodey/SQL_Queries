# SQL_Queries
A collection of SQL practice questions and solutions using SQLLite

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries I wrote to practice data analysis using **SQLite**.  
It covers basic to intermediate SQL concepts, including filtering, aggregation, joins, and subqueries.

Each query is written and tested in **SQLite** and focuses on improving real-world problem-solving with SQL.
